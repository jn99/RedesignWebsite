I choose to display two data sets on the same chart using Line Chart because the chart shows cleary the relationship between the renewable energy production and annual total electricity consumption in FLorida. I think the Line Chart is a good fit for both of the data sets. Looking at the chart, we can easily recognize that the electric consumption is getting much higher than electric production. User can also predict the future of energy resources.
